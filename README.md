# Guidebox
An app built for the coding challenge for 8tracks. The app takes in a JSON response from a get request to the 8tracks API, then formats that response into a tableView. You can tap on the individual cells to see a larger versoin of the picture, and the description of the playlist.




In order to make the code compile, you must have a Global.h file formatted like this:

#ifndef Global_h

#define Global_h


#define APIKEY @""

#endif /* Global_h */



Then all you need to go is put your API key in the quotes.
